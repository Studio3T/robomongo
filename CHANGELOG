0.9.0-RC6 / February 13, 2016
 
  Most important changes: support for MongoDB 3.x and WiredTiger engine. Robomongo 
  now embeds MongoDB 3.2 shell. It means that you can now use the latest
  shell functionality. Both MONGODB-CR and SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication mechanisms are
  supprted. Also, we now allow direct connections to Replica Set members and 
  support IPv6 protocol. Loading of huge list of collection names is now faster.

  Fixed incorrect representation of floating-point numbers (fixed since RC3).
  This bug was a reason of a big number of issues:

     #910, #748, #697, #699, #760, #815, #870, #892, 
     #894, #905, #945, #974, #978, #990, #831, #842
