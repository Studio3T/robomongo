  * What's new in Robomongo 1.0-RC1 (1 Feb, 2017)
    http://blog.robomongo.org/robomongo-1-rc1/
    
    New Features:
      - Replica set support.
      - New 'Attributes' column in connections list window showing connection properties such as 'Replica Set', 'SSL' and 'SSH'.  
      - New operation logging for almost all operations.

    Improvements:
      - Improved error handling (no double error windows) for all fail and success conditions for the following operations:
          . Create, Drop Database
          . Create, Edit User
          . Create, Drop, Duplicate, Rename Collection
          . Insert Document
          . Remove document, Delete document, Remove all documents (triggered both from explorer and from result widget)
          . Refresh Users
          . Refresh Functions
          . Refresh Collections
          . Connection establish & refresh server fail and success cases.
      - Windows size is saved and restored for Edit, View and Insert Document dialogs.
      - Connections are automatically imported from the latest Robomongo version.
      - Better error reporting/handling and logging have been added for the operations below:
          . Create, Drop Function
          . Drop User
      - More informative and adjusted log level prefix strings haven added for log window. (Error, Warn, Info etc..).
      - After a new connection is created, now the focus goes to the newly created connection (end of list) instead of the 
        beginning of connections list. And when Robomongo is opened, the focus goes to the end of the connection list instead 
        of beginning. 
      - Error messages added and error handling for 'remove document', 'remove all documents' operations triggered explorer 
        and single or multi 'delete document' from results window have been re-implemented and improved.
      - Relevant errors are shown for the following cases now:        
          . Drop attempt of non-existing collection.
          . Duplicating a collection with a collection name which already exists finishes silently.
    
    Fixes:
      - Fix for the problem where the connections list comes empty if the Robomongo config file or it's directory do not exist.
      - Fix for the problem where 'in-progress bar' widget was not centered on main window for "Update Documents/Remove Documents" 
        operations. https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/issues/1256
      - Fix for two problems where the operations 'insert or update documents' in one tab was causing auto reloading of other 
        unrelated tabs and also multiple error windows to popup. https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/issues/1236
      - Fix for the problem where the operations 'remove document', 'remove all documents' triggered explorer and single or 
        multi 'delete document' from results window were causing auto reloading of other unrelated tabs.
