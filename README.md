[Robomongo](http://www.robomongo.org) is a shell-centric cross-platform MongoDB management tool. Unlike most other MongoDB admin UI tools, Robomongo embeds the actual `mongo` shell in a tabbed interface with access to a shell command line as well as GUI interaction.

Starting from version 0.9, Robomongo is compatibile with MongoDB 3.x (including SCRAM-SHA-1 auth and support for WiredTiger storage engine). Robomongo 0.9 embeds the **MongoDB 3.2** shell.

Robomongo 0.8.x embeds the **MongoDB 2.4.0** shell.

Support
=======

Robomongo is an open source project driven by volunteers. We'll try to get to your questions as soon as we can, but please be patient :).

You can:

 - [Create a new issue in the Github issue queue](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/issues)

 - [Join developer discussion on Gitter](https://gitter.im/paralect/robomongo)

Build
=====

The wiki contains prerequisites and instructions to [Build Robomongo](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/wiki).

If you want to compile from source yourself, you should be able to do so cleanly from a [release branch](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/releases).

Contribute!
===========

### Suggest Features

New feature suggestions or UI improvements are always welcome.
[Create a new feature request on github](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/issues/new)

This project is powered by open source volunteers, so we have a limited amount of development resource to address all requests. We will certainly make best efforts to progress (particularly for those with strong community upvotes).

### Code Contributions

Code contributions are always welcome! Just try to follow our pre-commit checks and coding style: 
- [Robomongo Code Quality](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/wiki/Robomongo-Code-Quality)
- [Robomongo Coding Style](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/wiki/Robomongo-Coding-Style)

If you plan to contribute, please create a Github issue (or comment on the relevant existing issue) so we can help coordinate with upcoming release plans.

Pull requests (PRs) should generally be for discrete issues (i.e. one issue per PR please) and be clean to merge against the current master branch. It would also be helpful if you can confirm what testing has been done (specific O/S targets and MongoDB versions if applicable).

A usual naming approach for feature branches is `issue-###`. Include the issue number in your commit message / pull request description to link the PR to the original issue.

For example:
```#248: updated QScintilla to 2.4.8 for retina display support".```

### Design

There are some cosmetic issues we could use help with (designing images or UI). They are marked in the issue queue with a [`Cosmetic`](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/labels/cosmetic) label. If you see an open issue that you'd like to contribute to, please feel free to volunteer by commenting on it.

### Testing

There are a number of issues we could use help with reproducing. They are marked in the issue queue with a [`Needs Repro`](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/labels/needs%20repro) label. If you see an open issue that doesn't appear to be reproducible yet, please feel free to test and comment with your findings.
