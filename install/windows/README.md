How to generate ICO file from the set of PNGs
=============================================

Install ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/). Make sure that you
have added its utils to your PATH (installer will give you such an option)

In `icon-set` directory run:

    > convert 256x256.png 128x128.png 64x64.png 48x48.png 40x40.png 32x32.png 24x24.png 20x20.png 16x16.png robomongo.ico
    
File `robomongo.ico` will be generated.


Which icon sizes are used on Windows?
=====================================

The most important sizes are the one that is small. Robomongo should include 
16, 20, 24, 40, 48. The bigger sizes are usually scaled well, without notable
degrading in quality.
