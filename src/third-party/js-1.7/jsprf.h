***************************************************************************
** FUNCTION: JS_sscanf
** DESCRIPTION:
**     JS_sscanf() scans the input character string, performs data
**     conversions, and stores the converted values in the data objects
**     pointed to by its arguments according to the format control
**     string.
**
**     JS_sscanf() behaves the same way as the sscanf() function in the
**     Standard C Library (stdio.h), with the following exceptions:
**     - JS_sscanf() handles the NSPR integer and floating point types,
**       such as JSInt16, JSInt32, JSInt64, and JSFloat64, whereas
**       sscanf() handles the standard C types like short, int, long,
**       and double.
**     - JS_sscanf() has no multibyte character support, while sscanf()
**       does.
** INPUTS:
**     const char *buf
**         a character string holding the input to scan
**     const char *fmt
**         the format control string for the conversions
**     ...
**         variable number of arguments, each of them is a pointer to
**         a data object in which the converted value will be stored
** OUTPUTS: none
** RETURNS: JSInt32
**     The number of values converted and stored.
** RESTRICTIONS:
**    Multibyte characters in 'buf' or 'fmt' are not allowed.
