.SH NAME
libssh2_channel_free - free all resources associated with a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>

int 
libssh2_channel_free(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel);

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIchannel\fP - Channel stream to free.

Release all resources associated with a channel stream. If the channel has 
not yet been closed with 
.BR libssh2_channel_close(3)
, it will be called automatically so that the remote end may know that it 
can safely free its own resources.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Return 0 on success or negative on failure.  It returns
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
