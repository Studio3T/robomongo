.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmongodump\fP is a utility for creating a binary export of the
contents of a database. Consider using this utility as part of an
effective \fBbackup strategy\fP\&. Use
\fBmongodump\fP in conjunction with \fBmongorestore\fP to
restore databases.
.sp
\fBmongodump\fP can read data from either \fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP
instances, in addition to reading directly from MongoDB data files
without an active \fBmongod\fP\&.
.sp
\fBSEE ALSO:\fP

http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/backup\-sharded\-cluster\-with\-database\-dumps
and http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/backups\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH BEHAVIOR
.sp
\fBmongodump\fP does \fInot\fP dump the content of the \fBlocal\fP database.
.sp
The data format used by \fBmongodump\fP from version 2.2 or
later is \fIincompatible\fP with earlier versions of \fBmongod\fP\&.
Do not use recent versions of \fBmongodump\fP to back up older
data stores.
.sp
When running \fBmongodump\fP against a \fBmongos\fP instance
where the \fIsharded cluster\fP consists of \fIreplica sets\fP, the \fIread preference\fP of the operation will prefer reads
from \fIsecondary\fP members of the set.
.sp
Changed in version 2.2: When used in combination with \fBfsync\fP or
\fBdb.fsyncLock()\fP, \fBmongod\fP will block
reads, including those from \fBmongodump\fP, when
queued write operation waits behind the \fBfsync\fP
lock. Do not use \fBmongodump\fP with
\fBdb.fsyncLock()\fP\&.

.sp
\fBmongodump\fP overwrites output files if they exist in the
backup data folder. Before running the \fBmongodump\fP command
multiple times, either ensure that you no longer need the files in the
output folder (the default is the \fBdump/\fP folder) or rename the
folders or files.
.SH REQUIRED ACCESS
.SS Backup Collections
.sp
To backup all the databases in a cluster via \fBmongodump\fP, you
should have the \fBbackup\fP role. The \fBbackup\fP role provides
the required privileges for backing up all databases. The role confers no
additional access, in keeping with the policy of \fIleast privilege\fP\&.
.sp
To backup a given database, you must have \fBread\fP access on the database.
Several roles provide this access, including the \fBbackup\fP role.
.sp
To backup the \fBsystem.profile\fP
collection, which is created when you activate \fIdatabase profiling\fP, you must have \fBadditional\fP
\fBread\fP access on this collection. Several
roles provide this access, including the \fBclusterAdmin\fP and
\fBdbAdmin\fP roles.
.SS Backup Users
.sp
Changed in version 2.6.

.sp
To backup users and \fIuser\-defined roles\fP for a
given database, you must have access to the \fBadmin\fP database. MongoDB
stores the user data and role definitions for all databases in the
\fBadmin\fP database.
.sp
Specifically, to backup a given database\(aqs users, you must have the
\fBfind\fP \fIaction\fP on the \fBadmin\fP
database\(aqs \fBadmin.system.users\fP collection. The \fBbackup\fP
and \fBuserAdminAnyDatabase\fP roles both provide this privilege.
.sp
To backup the user\-defined roles on a database, you must have the
\fBfind\fP action on the \fBadmin\fP database\(aqs
\fBadmin.system.roles\fP collection. Both the \fBbackup\fP and
\fBuserAdminAnyDatabase\fP roles provide this privilege.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Changed in version 3.0.0: \fBmongodump\fP removed the \fB\-\-dbpath\fP as well as related
\fB\-\-directoryperdb\fP and \fB\-\-journal\fP options. You must use
\fBmongodump\fP while connected to a \fBmongod\fP instance.

\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the \fBmongo\fP shell or any other tool that connects to
\fBmongos\fP or \fBmongod\fP is run without
\fI\-\-sslCAFile\fP, it will not attempt to validate
server certificates. This results in vulnerability to expired
\fBmongod\fP and \fBmongos\fP certificates as well as to foreign
processes posing as valid \fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP
instances. Ensure that you \fIalways\fP specify the CA file against which
server certificates should be validated in cases where intrusion is a
possibility.

Specifies the password to de\-crypt the certificate\-key file (i.e.
\fI\-\-sslPEMKeyFile\fP). Use the \fI\-\-sslPEMKeyPassword\fP option only if the
certificate\-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the \fBmongodump\fP will
redact the password from all logging and reporting output.
.sp
If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
the \fI\-\-sslPEMKeyPassword\fP option, the \fBmongodump\fP will prompt for a passphrase. See
\fIssl\-certificate\-password\fP\&.

.TP
.B \-\-forceTableScan
Forces \fBmongodump\fP to scan the data store directly: typically,
\fBmongodump\fP saves entries as they appear in the index of
the \fB_id\fP field. If you specify a query \fI\-\-query\fP,
\fBmongodump\fP will use the most appropriate index to support that query.
.sp
Use \fI\-\-forceTableScan\fP to skip the index and scan the data directly. Typically
there are two cases where this behavior is preferable to the
default:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
If you have key sizes over 800 bytes that would not be present in the
\fB_id\fP index.
.IP 2. 3
Your database uses a custom \fB_id\fP field.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you run with \fI\-\-forceTableScan\fP, \fBmongodump\fP does
not use \fB$snapshot\fP\&. As a result, the dump produced by
\fBmongodump\fP can reflect the state of the database at many
different points in time.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use \fI\-\-forceTableScan\fP with extreme caution and
consideration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-out <path>, \-o <path>
Specifies the directory where \fBmongodump\fP will write
\fIBSON\fP files for the dumped databases. By default,
\fBmongodump\fP saves output files in a directory named
\fBdump\fP in the current working directory.
.sp
To send the database dump to standard output, specify "\fB\-\fP" instead of
a path. Write to standard output if you want process the output before
saving it, such as to use \fBgzip\fP to compress the dump. When writing
standard output, \fBmongodump\fP does not write the metadata that
writes in a \fB<dbname>.metadata.json\fP file when writing to files
directly.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-repair
Runs a repair option in addition to dumping the
database. The repair option changes the behavior of \fBmongodump\fP to
only write valid data and exclude data that may be in
an invalid state as a result of an improper shutdown or
\fBmongod\fP crash.
.sp
The \fI\%\-\-repair\fP option uses aggressive data\-recovery algorithms
that may produce a large amount of duplication.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-repair\fP is only available for use with \fBmongod\fP
instances using the \fBmmapv1\fP storage engine. You cannot run
\fI\%\-\-repair\fP with \fBmongos\fP or with \fBmongod\fP instances
that use the \fBwiredTiger\fP storage engine. To repair data in a
\fBmongod\fP instance using \fBwiredTiger\fP use
\fImongod \-\-repair\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-oplog
Ensures that \fBmongodump\fP creates a dump of
the database that includes a partial \fIoplog\fP containing operations
from the duration of the \fBmongodump\fP operation. This oplog
produces an effective point\-in\-time snapshot of the state of a
\fBmongod\fP instance. To restore to a specific point\-in\-time
backup, use the output created with this option in conjunction with
\fImongorestore \-\-oplogReplay\fP\&.
.sp
Without \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP, if there are write operations during the dump
operation, the dump will not reflect a single moment in time. Changes
made to the database during the update process can affect the output of
the backup.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP has no effect when running \fBmongodump\fP
against a \fBmongos\fP instance to dump the entire contents of a
sharded cluster. However, you can use \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP to dump
individual shards.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP only works against nodes that maintain an
\fIoplog\fP\&. This includes all members of a replica set, as well as
\fImaster\fP nodes in master/slave replication deployments.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP does not dump the oplog collection.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dumpDbUsersAndRoles
Includes user and role definitions when performing \fBmongodump\fP
on a specific database. This option applies only when you specify a
database in the \fI\-\-db\fP option. MongoDB always includes user and
role definitions when \fBmongodump\fP applies to an entire instance
and not just a specific database.
