 A light-weight compression algorithm.  It is designed for speed of
 compression and decompression, rather than for the utmost in space
 savings.

 For getting better compression ratios when you are compressing data
 with long repeated sequences or compressing data that is similar to
 other data, while still compressing fast, you might look at first
 using BMDiff and then compressing the output of BMDiff with
 Snappy.
