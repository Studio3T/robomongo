/**
 * Parses a number out of a StringData.
 *
 * Parses "stringValue", interpreting it as a number of the given "base".  On success, stores
 * the parsed value into "*result" and returns Status::OK().
 *
 * Valid values for "base" are 2-36, with 0 meaning "choose the base by inspecting the prefix
 * on the number", as in strtol.  Returns Status::BadValue if an illegal value is supplied for
 * "base".
 *
 * The entirety of the std::string must consist of digits in the given base, except optionally the
 * first character may be "+" or "-", and hexadecimal numbers may begin "0x".  Same as strtol,
 * without the property of stripping whitespace at the beginning, and fails to parse if there
 * are non-digit characters at the end of the string.
 *
 * See parse_number.cpp for the available instantiations, and add any new instantiations there.
