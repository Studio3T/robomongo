 *        2. 'alwaysOn' - fail point is always active.
 *        3. { activationProbability: <n> } - n should be a double between 0 and 1,
 *           representing the probability that the fail point will fire.  0 means never,
 *           1 means (nearly) always.
 *        4. { times: <n> } - n should be positive and within the range of a 32 bit
 *            signed integer and this is the number of passes on the fail point will
 *            remain activated.
