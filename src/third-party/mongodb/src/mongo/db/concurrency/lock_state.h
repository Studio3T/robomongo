 * Acquire the flush lock in S mode using AutoAcquireFlushLockForMMAPV1Commit. This waits until
 * all current write activity on the system completes and does not allow any new operations to
 * start.
 *
 * Once the S lock is granted, the flush thread writes the journal entries to disk (it is
 * guaranteed that there will not be any modifications) and applies them to the shared view.

 * After that, it upgrades the S lock to X and remaps the private view.
