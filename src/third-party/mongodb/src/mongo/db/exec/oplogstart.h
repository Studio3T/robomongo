/**
 * OplogStart walks a collection backwards to find the first object in the collection that
 * matches the query.  It's used by replication to efficiently find where the oplog should be
 * replayed from.
 *
 * The oplog is always a capped collection.  In capped collections, documents are oriented on
 * disk according to insertion order.  The oplog inserts documents with increasing timestamps.
 * Queries on the oplog look for entries that are after a certain time.  Therefore if we
 * navigate backwards, the last document we encounter that satisfies our query (over the
 * timestamp) is the first document we must scan from to answer the query.
 *
 * Why isn't this a normal reverse table scan, you may ask?  We could be correct if we used a
 * normal reverse collection scan.  However, that's not fast enough.  Since we know all
 * documents are oriented on disk in insertion order, we know all documents in one extent were
 * inserted before documents in a subsequent extent.  As such we can skip through entire extents
 * looking only at the first document.
 *
 * Why is this a stage?  Because we want to yield, and we want to be notified of RecordId
 * invalidations.  :(
