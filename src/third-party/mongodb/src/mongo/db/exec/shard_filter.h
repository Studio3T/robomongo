/**
 * This stage drops documents that didn't belong to the shard we're executing on at the time of
 * construction. This matches the contract for sharded cursorids which guarantees that a
 * StaleConfigException will be thrown early or the cursorid for its entire lifetime will return
 * documents matching the shard version set on the connection at the time of cursorid creation.
 *
 * A related system will ensure that the data migrated away from a shard will not be deleted as
 * long as there are active queries from before the migration. Currently, "active queries" is
 * defined by cursorids so it is important that the metadata used in this stage uses the same
 * version as the cursorid. Therefore, you must wrap any Runner using this Stage in a
 * ClientCursor during the same lock grab as constructing the Runner.
 *
 * BEGIN NOTE FROM GREG
 *
 * There are three sharded query contracts:
 *
 * 0) Migration commit takes the db lock - i.e. is serialized with writes and reads.
 * 1) No data should be returned from a query in ranges of migrations that committed after the
 * query started, or from ranges not owned when the query began.
 * 2) No migrated data should be removed from a shard while there are queries that were active
 * before the migration.
 *
 * As implementation details, collection metadata is used to determine the ranges of all data
 * not actively migrated (or orphaned).  CursorIds are currently used to establish "active"
 * queries before migration commit.
 *
 * Combining all this: if a query is started in a db lock and acquires in that (same) lock the
 * collection metadata and a cursorId, the query will return results for exactly the ranges in
 * the metadata (though of arbitrary staleness).  This is the sharded collection query contract.
 *
 * END NOTE FROM GREG
 *
 * Preconditions: Child must be fetched.  TODO: when covering analysis is in just build doc
 * and check that against shard key.  See SERVER-5022.
