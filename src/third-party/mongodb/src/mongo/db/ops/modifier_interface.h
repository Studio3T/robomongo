/**
 * Abstract base class for update "modifiers" (a.k.a "$ operators"). To create a new
 * operator, implement a new derived class.
 *
 * A typical call sequence for the class is:
 *
 *   + init() with the mod arguments
 *
 *   + For each document that is being touched on that update, the following methods are
 *     going to be called once for that document and in the order the calls appear here.
 *
 *     + prepare() to check if mod is viable over the document
 *
 *     + apply(), effectively computing the update
 *
 *     + log() registering the change in the log for replication purposes
 *
 * Again, a modifier implementation may rely on these last three calls being made and in
 * that particular order and therefore can keep and reuse state between these calls, when
 * appropriate.
 *
 * TODO:
 * For a reference implementation, see modifier_identity.{h,cpp} used in tests.
