 * Finds the longest portion of 'prefix' that exists in document rooted at 'root' and is
 * "viable." A viable path is one that, if fully created on a given doc, would not
 * change the existing types of any fields in that doc. (See examples below.)
 *
 * If a prefix indeed exists, 'idxFound' is set to indicate how many parts in common
 * 'prefix' and 'doc' have. 'elemFound' would point to the Element corresponding to
 * prefix[idxFound] in 'doc'. The call would return an OK status in this case.
 *
 * If a prefix is not viable, returns a status "PathNotViable". 'idxFound' is set to
 * indicate the part in the document that caused the path to be not viable. 'elemFound'
 * would point to the Element corresponding to prefix[idxFound] in 'doc'.
 *
 * If a prefix does not exist, the call returns "NonExistentPath". 'elemFound' and
 * 'idxFound' are indeterminate in this case.
 *
 * Definition of a "Viable Path":
 *
 *   A field reference 'p_1.p_2.[...].p_n', where 'p_i' is a field part, is said to be
 *   a viable path in a given document D if the creation of each part 'p_i', 0 <= i < n
 *   in D does not force 'p_i' to change types. In other words, no existing 'p_i' in D
 *   may have a different type, other than the 'p_n'.
 *
 *   'a.b.c' is a viable path in {a: {b: {c: 1}}}
 *   'a.b.c' is a viable path in {a: {b: {c: {d: 1}}}}
 *   'a.b.c' is NOT a viable path in {a: {b: 1}}, because b would have changed types
 *   'a.0.b' is a viable path in {a: [{b: 1}, {c: 1}]}
 *   'a.0.b' is a viable path in {a: {"0": {b: 1}}}
 *   'a.0.b' is NOT a viable path in {a: 1}, because a would have changed types
 *   'a.5.b' is a viable path in in {a: []} (padding would occur)
