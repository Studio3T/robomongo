 * How a PlanCacheIndexTree is used:
 *   When the query planner is planning from the cache, it uses
 *   the PlanCacheIndexTree retrieved from the cache in order to
 *   recreate index assignments. Specifically, a raw MatchExpression
 *   is tagged according to the index tags in the PlanCacheIndexTree.
