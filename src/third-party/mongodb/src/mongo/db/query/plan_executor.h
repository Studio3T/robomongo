        // be done per-yield (as described below).
        //
        // 2. Construct a PlanYieldPolicy 'policy', passing 'exec' to the constructor.
        //
        // 3. Call PlanYieldPolicy::yield() on 'policy'. If your PlanExecutor is not yet
        // registered (because you want to register on a per-yield basis), then pass
        // 'true' to yield().
        //
        // 4. The call to yield() returns a boolean indicating whether or not 'exec' is
        // still alove. If it is false, then 'exec' was killed during the yield and is
        // no longer valid.

    //   3) While executing the plan inside executePlan().
