     * Rewrites an index scan over many point intervals as an OR of many index scans in order to
     * obtain an indexed sort.  For full details, see SERVER-1205.
     *
     * Here is an example:
     *
     * Consider the query find({a: {$in: [1,2]}}).sort({b: 1}) with using the index {a:1, b:1}.
     *
     * Our default solution will be to construct one index scan with the bounds a:[[1,1],[2,2]]
     * and b: [MinKey, MaxKey].
     *
     * However, this is logically equivalent to the union of the following scans:
     * a:[1,1], b:[MinKey, MaxKey]
     * a:[2,2], b:[MinKey, MaxKey]
     *
     * Since the bounds on 'a' are a point, each scan provides the sort order {b:1} in addition
     * to {a:1, b:1}.
     *
     * If we union these scans with a merge sort instead of a normal hashing OR, we can preserve
     * the sort order that each scan provides.
