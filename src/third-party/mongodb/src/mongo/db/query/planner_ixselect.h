     * stripped off the subtree rooted at 'node'.
     *

     * more complex plan.

     * Example:
     *   Suppose you have match expression OR (AND (a==1, b==2), AND (c==3, d==4)).

     *   a single key lookup is ever available, all assignments in this subtree
     *   are stripped, except for the assignment of d==4 to the unique 'd' index.
     *
     *   Stripping the assignment for 'c' causes the planner to generate just two
     *   possible plans:
     *     1) an OR of an index scan over 'a' and an index scan over 'd'
     *     2) an OR of an index scan over 'b' and an index scan over 'd'

     * A predicate on a field from a compound text index with a non-empty index prefix
     * (e.g. pred {a: 1, b: 1} on index {a: 1, b: 1, c: "text"}) is only considered valid to
     * assign to the text index if it is a direct child of an AND with the following properties:
     * - it has a TEXT child
     * - for every index prefix component, it has an EQ child on that component's path
     *
     * Note that compatible() enforces the precondition that only EQ nodes are considered
     * relevant to text index prefixes.
     * If there is a relevant compound text index with a non-empty "index prefix" (e.g. the
     * prefix {a: 1, b: 1} for the index {a: 1, b: 1, c: "text"}), amend the RelevantTag(s)
     * created above to remove assignments to the text index where the query does not have
     * predicates over each indexed field of the prefix.
     *
     * This is necessary because text indices do not obey the normal rules of sparseness, in
     * that they generate no index keys for documents without indexable text data in at least
     * one text field (in fact, text indices ignore the sparse option entirely).  For example,
     * given the text index {a: 1, b: 1, c: "text"}:
     *
     * - Document {a: 1, b: 6, c: "hello world"} generates 2 index keys
     * - Document {a: 1, b: 7, c: {d: 1}} generates 0 index keys
     * - Document {a: 1, b: 8} generates 0 index keys
     *
     * As a result, the query {a: 1} *cannot* be satisfied by the text index {a: 1, b: 1, c:
     * "text"}, since documents without indexed text data would not be returned by the query.
     * rateIndices() above will eagerly annotate the pred {a: 1} as relevant to the text index;
     * those annotations get removed here.
