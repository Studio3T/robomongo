 * This interface is a work in progress.  Notes below:
 *
 * This interface began as the SortedDataInterface, a way to hide the fact that there were two
 * on-disk formats for the btree.  With the introduction of other storage engines, this
 * interface was generalized to provide access to sorted data.  Specifically:
 *
 * 1. Many other storage engines provide different Btree(-ish) implementations.  This interface
 * could allow those interfaces to avoid storing btree buckets in an already sorted structure.
 *
 * TODO: See if there is actually a performance gain.
 *
 * 2. The existing btree implementation is written to assume that if it modifies a record it is
 * modifying the underlying record.  This interface is an attempt to work around that.
 *
 * TODO: See if this actually works.
