 * The 'WireVersion' captures all "protocol events" the write protocol went through.  A
 * protocol event is a change in the syntax of messages on the wire or the semantics of
 * existing messages. We may also add "logical" entries for releases, although that's not
 * mandatory.
 *
 * We use the wire version to determine if two agents (a driver, a mongos, or a mongod) can
 * interact. Each agent carries two versions, a 'max' and a 'min' one. If the two agents
 * are on the same 'max' number, they stricly speak the same wire protocol and it is safe
 * to allow them to communicate. If two agents' ranges do not intersect, they should not be
 * allowed to communicate.
 *
 * If two agents have at least one version in common they can communicate, but one of the
 * sides has to be ready to compensate for not being on its partner version.
