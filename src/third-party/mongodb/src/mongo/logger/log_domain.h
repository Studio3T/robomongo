/**
 * Logging domain for events of type E.
 *
 * A logging domain consists of a set of Appenders.
 *
 * TODO: The severity doesn't seem to apply for auditing, maybe it only belongs on the
 * MessageLogManager?  We don't really have multiple tunable logging domains, right now.  Other
 * than the global domain, shouldLog doesn't matter.
 *
 * Usage: Configure the log domain in a single threaded context, using attachAppender,
 * detachAppender and clearAppenders().  The domain takes ownership of any attached appender,
 * returning an AppenderHandle for each attached appender.  That handle may be used later to
 * detach the appender, causing the domain to release ownership of it.  Mostly, this
 * attach/detach behavior is useful in testing, since you do not want to change the appenders of
 * a domain that is currently receiving append() calls.
 *
 * Once you've configured the domain, call append() from potentially many threads, to add log
 * messages.
