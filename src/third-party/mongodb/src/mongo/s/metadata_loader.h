 * The MetadataLoader is responsible for interfacing with the config servers and previous
 * metadata to build new instances of CollectionMetadata.  MetadataLoader is the "builder"
 * class for metadata.
 *
 * CollectionMetadata has both persisted and volatile state (for now) - the persisted
 * config server chunk state and the volatile pending state which is only tracked locally
 * while a server is the primary.  This requires a two-step loading process - the persisted
 * chunk state *cannot* be loaded in a DBLock lock while the pending chunk state *must* be.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * beforeMetadata = <get latest local metadata>;
 * remoteMetadata = makeCollectionMetadata( beforeMetadata, remoteMetadata );
 * DBLock lock(txn, dbname, MODE_X);
 * afterMetadata = <get latest local metadata>;
 * promotePendingChunks( afterMetadata, remoteMetadata );
 *
 * The loader will go out of its way to try to fetch the smaller amount possible of data
 * from the config server without sacrificing the freshness and accuracy of the metadata it
 * builds. (See ConfigDiffTracker class.)
 *
 * The class is not thread safe.
