     * Primarily this just checks whether the shard key pattern field names are equal to or a

     * the shard key pattern are guaranteed to go to the same shard, and all documents must

     *
     * Hashed shard key patterns are similar to ordinary patterns in that they guarantee similar
     * shard keys go to the same shard.

     *     shard key {a : 1} is compatible with a unique index on {_id : 1}
     *     shard key {a : 1} is compatible with a unique index on {a : 1 , b : 1}

     *     shard key {a : "hashed"} is compatible with a unique index on {a : 1}
     *     shard key {a : 1} is not compatible with a unique index on {b : 1}
     *     shard key {a : "hashed" , b : 1 } is not compatible with unique index on { b : 1 }
     *
     * All unique index patterns starting with _id are assumed to be enforceable by the fact
     * that _ids must be unique, and so all unique _id prefixed indexes are compatible with
     * any shard key pattern.
     *
     * NOTE: We assume 'uniqueIndexPattern' is a valid unique index pattern - a pattern like
     * { k : "hashed" } is not capable of being a unique index and is an invalid argument to
     * this method.
