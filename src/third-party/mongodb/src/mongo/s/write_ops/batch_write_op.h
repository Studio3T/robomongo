/**
 * The BatchWriteOp class manages the lifecycle of a batched write received by mongos.  Each
 * item in a batch is tracked via a WriteOp, and the function of the BatchWriteOp is to
 * aggregate the dispatched requests and responses for the underlying WriteOps.
 *
 * Overall, the BatchWriteOp lifecycle is similar to the WriteOp lifecycle, with the following
 * stages:
 *
 * 0) Client request comes in, batch write op is initialized
 *
 * 1a) One or more ops in the batch are targeted using targetBatch, resulting in
 *     TargetedWriteBatches for these ops.
 * 1b) There are targeting errors, and the batch must be retargeted after refreshing the
 *     NSTargeter.
 *
 * 2) (Child BatchCommandRequests are be built for each TargetedWriteBatch before sending)
 *
 * 3) Responses for sent TargetedWriteBatches are noted, errors are stored and aggregated per-
 *    write-op.  Errors the caller is interested in are returned.
 *
 * 4) If the batch write is not finished, goto 0
 *
 * 5) When all responses come back for all write ops, errors are aggregated and returned in
 *    a client response
