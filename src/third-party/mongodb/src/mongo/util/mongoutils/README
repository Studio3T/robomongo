    mongoutils namespace requirements:

    (1) code is not database specific, rather, true utilities
    (2) are cross platform
    (3) may require boost headers, but not libs
    (4) are clean and easy to use in any c++ project without pulling in lots of other stuff.
        specifically, does not use anything in the mongo namespace!
    (5) apache license
    (6) must be documented!  if you aren't going to bother (but don't do that), stick it in util.
    (7) ideally header only (in the spirit of #3)

    So basically, easy to use, general purpose stuff, with no arduous dependencies to drop into 
    any new project.

    *** PLACE UNIT TESTS IN mongoutils/test.cpp ***
