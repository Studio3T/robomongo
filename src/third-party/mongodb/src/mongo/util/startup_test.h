/* The idea here is to let all initialization of global variables (classes inheriting from

   complete before we run the tests -- otherwise order of initilization being arbitrary may mess
   us up.  The app's main() function should call runTests().

   To define a unit test, inherit from this and implement run. instantiate one object for the new
   class as a global.

   These tests are ran on *every* startup of mongod, so they have to be very lightweight.  But it is
   a good quick check for a bad build.
