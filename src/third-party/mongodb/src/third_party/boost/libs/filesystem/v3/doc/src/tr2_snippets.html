<h1>Filesystem Library for C++11/TR2 (Revision 1)</h1>


<p>This paper proposes that the&nbsp;filesystem library component of <i>C++ Standard 
Library Technical Report 2</i> be based on Version 3 of the Boost Filesystem 
Library (see <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem">
www.boost.org/libs/filesystem</a>). Preliminary wording is provided. A
<a href="#TODO">TODO</a> list identifies remaining work to be done.</p>


<h2>Revision history</h2>


<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3335.html">
N3335=12-0025</a>, Filesystem Library for C++11/TR2 (Revision 1). Changes 
include:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>Regenerated the proposed wording from the Boost Filesystem library 
    reference documentation, using an automated process. This process reduces 
    the likelihood of inadvertent discrepancies between descriptions.</li>
    <li>An <a href="#Issues-List">Issues list</a> was added, seeded with issues 
    raised by the LWG review of N3239 at the Bloomington meeting, and private 
    communications from LWG members.</li>
    <li>Namespace changed to <code>files</code> as an experiment. Made this 
    issue number 1 so the LWG can pass judgement.</li>
    <li>New functions were added, suggested by David Svoboda, to generate 
    canonical paths and manage permissions.</li>
    <li>More C++11 functionality was applied. This process is still incomplete, 
    however.</li>
    <li>Added proposed changes to header &lt;fstream&gt;. The previous paper had 
    inadvertently supplied the wrong wording.</li>
    <li>Continued the general cleanup of wording.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3239.html">
N3239 = 11-0009</a>, Filesystem Library Update for TR2 (Preliminary), reflected 
changes made to the Boost library version 3 since the previously accepted 
committee paper:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>A single class <code>path</code> handles all aspects of 
    internationalization, replacing the previous template and its <code>path</code> 
    and <code>wpath</code> instantiations. Character types <code>char</code>,
    <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>char16_t</code>, and <code>char32_t</code> are 
    supported. This is a major simplification of the path abstraction, 
    particularly for functions that take path arguments. This change was based 
    on a suggestion by Peter Dimov.</li>
    <li>Several operational functions have been added, including much better 
    symlink support, the ability to resize a file, and the ability to generate a 
    unique path.</li>
    <li>Support for error reporting via <code>error_code</code> is now uniform 
    throughout the operations functions.</li>
    <li>Several functions have been renamed, based on feedback from users.</li>
  </ul>


<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
N1975 = 06-0045</a>, Filesystem Library Proposal for TR2 (Revision 3), was 
adopted by the committee in April, 2006, at the Berlin meeting. Shortly 
afterward the Library Working Group set aside work on TR2 to concentrate on 
C++0x.</p>


<h2>Motivation and Scope</h2>


<p>The motivation and scope for a filesystem library were described in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
N1975</a>, and are not repeated here. A minor scope reduction is that an 
addition to the current C++ runtime library is no longer needed.</p>


<p>Boost Filesystem Version 3  introduced a single path type that interoperates well with both <code>
basic_string</code> and user defined string types. Thus the following Design 
alternatives paragraph is no long applicable:</p>


  <blockquote>


<p><strike><i>Single path type which can at runtime accept narrow or wide character 
pathnames.</i> Although certainly interesting, and possibly superior, such a 
design would not interoperate well with the current Standard Library's 
compile-time typed <code>basic_string</code>. A new runtime polymorphic string 
class would be the best place to experiment with this concept, not a path class.</strike></p>


  </blockquote>


  <h2><a name="TODO">TODO</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply more C++0X features. Boost.Filesystem needs to implement these to verify their 
    application is correct.</li>
    <li>Boost.Filesystem needs to implement <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> support to verify the 
    specification for these is correct.</li>
    <li>Replace path inserter and extractor <i>Effects</i> with prose, since the 
    current wording relies on 
  <code>boost::io::quoted</code></span>.</li>
    <li>The Boost implementation has more class path non-member relational 
    functions that shown in the docs, and the specific set of relational 
    functions varies between Windows and POSIX. Figure out what's happening and 
    document it.</li>
    <li><code><a href="#Source">Source</a></code> is not specified as actually 
    implemented. Expose <code>path_traits</code>?</li>
    <li><i>Effects</i> for <code>copy</code> and <code>copy_directory</code> 
    need to be reviewed, revised, tested, peer reviewed.</li>
    <li>Review changes to header &lt;fstream&gt;. Add semantics. Add section 
    names. Verify still in sync with WP.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><a name="Issues-List">Issues List</a></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 1: What is the appropriate namespace?</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The proposal places the library in <code>namespace std::tr2::$SUBNAMESPACE;</code>. 
Rationale for a sub-namespace is that the library uses several names that don't 
seem appropriate for namespace <code>tr2</code> since full standardization would 
then put the names into <code>std</code>. The function names <code>remove</code> 
and <code>rename</code> are of particular concern because these functions differ 
in behavior from current standard library functions with those names. It also 
doesn't seem desirable to preempt names like <code>equivalent</code> and <code>
status</code>.</p>
<p>The Boost Filesystem library used <code>namespace boost::filesystem</code>, 
but that always seemed a bit too long.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p>Status quo. Leave in <code>namespace std::tr2::$SUBNAMESPACE;</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 2: Excessive use of <code>const codecvt_type&amp;</code> arguments</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Users sometimes need to do path conversions that use something other than the 
imbued codecvt facet. The need is particularly acute in multi-threaded 
applications where changing the imbued facet would introduce a data race. That 
said, providing an optional <code>const codecvt_type&amp;</code> argument for every 
function where the need might possibly arise is excessive because its use is so 
rare and it adds considerable interface clutter.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Remove all existing class path <code>const codecvt_type&amp;</code> 
arguments.</p>
<p>Add an additional non-member function:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>unspecified-iterator-type convert(<code>const path&amp; p, const codecvt_type&amp; codecvt</code>);</pre>
  <p dir="ltr"><i>Returns: </i>An unspecified iterator type whose value type is
  <code>path::value_type</code>. The returned iterator points to the beginning 
  of a sequence equivalent to <code>p.native()</code> with encoding as specified 
  by <code>codecvt</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 3: Possible &quot;implicit cast to native type&quot;?</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>In Bloomington there was discussion of &quot;implicit cast to implicit cast to 
native OS type to inter operate with existing iostream library and native 
functions instead of modifying fstream&quot;.</p>
<p>Beman comments: I wasn't in Bloomington and am not sure of the context of the 
above. N3239 inadvertently included the Boost docs for &lt;fstream&gt; rather than 
suggested &lt;fstream&gt; changes for TR2, and that may have caused some confusion. Or 
maybe I'm just missing something from the wiki notes. Some further discussions 
are needed to better define the issue.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 4: Given move semantics, it is best not to return const strings.</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The issue title pretty much says it all.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p>As part of the C++11 refinements to the interface, review returns of const 
strings and change to plain strings where appropriate.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 5: Is there a way to handle characters that are illegal for particular 
OS?</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Question raised by Pablo in Bloomington.</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
<p>Beman suggests NAD, Future. I've done some work on this, including looking at 
systems like OpenVMS that have an escape mechanism to handle otherwise 
unrepresentable characters. There was a comment to that effect in N3239. I 
believe it should be deferred to some future release since (1) it is complex 
enough that I'd like to see actual implementation and use experience (presumably 
via Boost), and (2) I can't recall a user ever requesting such a feature.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Issue 6: Could allocator support be class path?</h3>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Question raised by a committee member in private email.</p>
<p>Comment from Beman: How would allocator support work, given that class path 
is not a template?</p>
<h4>Proposed resolution</h4>
