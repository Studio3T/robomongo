/*
 * Given P independent, non-unique properties each of size S words mapped by
 * all scopes in a runtime, construct a property tree of N nodes each of size
 * S+L words (L for tree linkage).  A nominal L value is 2 for leftmost-child
 * and right-sibling links.  We hope that the N < P by enough that the space
 * overhead of L, and the overhead of scope entries pointing at property tree
 * nodes, is worth it.
 *
 * The tree construction goes as follows.  If any empty scope in the runtime
 * has a property X added to it, find or create a node under the tree root
 * labeled X, and set scope->lastProp to point at that node.  If any non-empty
 * scope whose most recently added property is labeled Y has another property
 * labeled Z added, find or create a node for Z under the node that was added
 * for Y, and set scope->lastProp to point at that node.
 *
 * A property is labeled by its members' values: id, getter, setter, slot,
 * attributes, tiny or short id, and a field telling for..in order.  Note that
 * labels are not unique in the tree, but they are unique among a node's kids
 * (barring rare and benign multi-threaded race condition outcomes, see below)
 * and along any ancestor line from the tree root to a given leaf node (except
 * for the hard case of duplicate formal parameters to a function).
 *
 * Thus the root of the tree represents all empty scopes, and the first ply
 * of the tree represents all scopes containing one property, etc.  Each node
 * in the tree can stand for any number of scopes having the same ordered set
 * of properties, where that node was the last added to the scope.  (We need
 * not store the root of the tree as a node, and do not -- all we need are
 * links to its kids.)
 *
 * Sidebar on for..in loop order: ECMA requires no particular order, but this
 * implementation has promised and delivered property definition order, and
 * compatibility is king.  We could use an order number per property, which
 * would require a sort in js_Enumerate, and an entry order generation number
 * per scope.  An order number beats a list, which should be doubly-linked for
 * O(1) delete.  An even better scheme is to use a parent link in the property
 * tree, so that the ancestor line can be iterated from scope->lastProp when
 * filling in a JSIdArray from back to front.  This parent link also helps the
 * GC to sweep properties iteratively.
 *
 * What if a property Y is deleted from a scope?  If Y is the last property in
 * the scope, we simply adjust the scope's lastProp member after we remove the
 * scope's hash-table entry pointing at that property node.  The parent link
 * mentioned in the for..in sidebar above makes this adjustment O(1).  But if
 * Y comes between X and Z in the scope, then we might have to "fork" the tree
 * at X, leaving X->Y->Z in case other scopes have those properties added in
 * that order; and to finish the fork, we'd add a node labeled Z with the path
 * X->Z, if it doesn't exist.  This could lead to lots of extra nodes, and to
 * O(n^2) growth when deleting lots of properties.
 *
 * Rather, for O(1) growth all around, we should share the path X->Y->Z among
 * scopes having those three properties added in that order, and among scopes
 * having only X->Z where Y was deleted.  All such scopes have a lastProp that
 * points to the Z child of Y.  But a scope in which Y was deleted does not
 * have a table entry for Y, and when iterating that scope by traversing the
 * ancestor line from Z, we will have to test for a table entry for each node,
 * skipping nodes that lack entries.
 *
 * What if we add Y again?  X->Y->Z->Y is wrong and we'll enumerate Y twice.
 * Therefore we must fork in such a case, if not earlier.  Because delete is
 * "bursty", we should not fork eagerly.  Delaying a fork till we are at risk
 * of adding Y after it was deleted already requires a flag in the JSScope, to
 * wit, SCOPE_MIDDLE_DELETE.
 *
 * What about thread safety?  If the property tree operations done by requests
 * are find-node and insert-node, then the only hazard is duplicate insertion.
 * This is harmless except for minor bloat.  When all requests have ended or
 * been suspended, the GC is free to sweep the tree after marking all nodes
 * reachable from scopes, performing remove-node operations as needed.  Note
 * also that the stable storage of the property nodes during active requests
 * permits the property cache (see jsinterp.h) to dereference JSScopeProperty
 * weak references safely.
 *
 * Is the property tree worth it compared to property storage in each table's
 * entries?  To decide, we must find the relation <> between the words used
 * with a property tree and the words required without a tree.
 *
 * Model all scopes as one super-scope of capacity T entries (T a power of 2).
 * Let alpha be the load factor of this double hash-table.  With the property
 * tree, each entry in the table is a word-sized pointer to a node that can be
 * shared by many scopes.  But all such pointers are overhead compared to the
 * situation without the property tree, where the table stores property nodes
 * directly, as entries each of size S words.  With the property tree, we need
 * L=2 extra words per node for siblings and kids pointers.  Without the tree,
 * (1-alpha)*S*T words are wasted on free or removed sentinel-entries required
 * by double hashing.
 *
 * Therefore,
 *
 *      (property tree)                 <> (no property tree)
 *      N*(S+L) + T                     <> S*T
 *      N*(S+L) + T                     <> P*S + (1-alpha)*S*T
 *      N*(S+L) + alpha*T + (1-alpha)*T <> P*S + (1-alpha)*S*T
 *
 * Note that P is alpha*T by definition, so
 *
 *      N*(S+L) + P + (1-alpha)*T <> P*S + (1-alpha)*S*T
 *      N*(S+L)                   <> P*S - P + (1-alpha)*S*T - (1-alpha)*T
 *      N*(S+L)                   <> (P + (1-alpha)*T) * (S-1)
 *      N*(S+L)                   <> (P + (1-alpha)*P/alpha) * (S-1)
 *      N*(S+L)                   <> P * (1/alpha) * (S-1)
 *
 * Let N = P*beta for a compression ratio beta, beta <= 1:
 *
 *      P*beta*(S+L) <> P * (1/alpha) * (S-1)
 *      beta*(S+L)   <> (S-1)/alpha
 *      beta         <> (S-1)/((S+L)*alpha)
 *
 * For S = 6 (32-bit architectures) and L = 2, the property tree wins iff
 *
 *      beta < 5/(8*alpha)
 *
 * We ensure that alpha <= .75, so the property tree wins if beta < .83_.  An
 * average beta from recent Mozilla browser startups was around .6.
 *
 * Can we reduce L?  Observe that the property tree degenerates into a list of
 * lists if at most one property Y follows X in all scopes.  In or near such a
 * case, we waste a word on the right-sibling link outside of the root ply of
 * the tree.  Note also that the root ply tends to be large, so O(n^2) growth
 * searching it is likely, indicating the need for hashing (but with increased
 * thread safety costs).
 *
 * If only K out of N nodes in the property tree have more than one child, we
 * could eliminate the sibling link and overlay a children list or hash-table
 * pointer on the leftmost-child link (which would then be either null or an
 * only-child link; the overlay could be tagged in the low bit of the pointer,
 * or flagged elsewhere in the property tree node, although such a flag must
 * not be considered when comparing node labels during tree search).
 *
 * For such a system, L = 1 + (K * averageChildrenTableSize) / N instead of 2.
 * If K << N, L approaches 1 and the property tree wins if beta < .95.
 *
 * We observe that fan-out below the root ply of the property tree appears to
 * have extremely low degree (see the MeterPropertyTree code that histograms
 * child-counts in jsscope.c), so instead of a hash-table we use a linked list
 * of child node pointer arrays ("kid chunks").  The details are isolated in
 * jsscope.c; others must treat JSScopeProperty.kids as opaque.  We leave it
 * strongly typed for debug-ability of the common (null or one-kid) cases.
 *
 * One final twist (can you stand it?): the mean number of entries per scope
 * in Mozilla is < 5, with a large standard deviation (~8).  Instead of always
 * allocating scope->table, we leave it null while initializing all the other
 * scope members as if it were non-null and minimal-length.  Until a property
 * is added that crosses the threshold of 6 or more entries for hashing, or
 * until a "middle delete" occurs, we use linear search from scope->lastProp
 * to find a given id, and save on the space overhead of a hash table.
