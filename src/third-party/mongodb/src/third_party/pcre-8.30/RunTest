# Run the PCRE tests using the pcretest program. The appropriate tests are
# selected, depending on which build-time options were used.

# All tests are now run both with and without -s, to ensure that everything is
# tested with and without studying. However, there are some tests that produce
# different output after studying, typically when we are tracing the actual
# matching process (for example, using auto-callouts). In these few cases, the
# tests are duplicated in the files, one with /S to force studying always, and
# one with /SS to force *not* studying always. The use of -s doesn't then make
# any difference to their output. There is also one test which compiles invalid
# UTF-8 with the UTF-8 check turned off; for this, studying must also be
# disabled with /SS.

# When JIT support is available, all the tests are also run with -s+ to test
# (again, almost) everything with studying and the JIT option. There are also
# two tests for JIT-specific features, one to be run when JIT support is
# available, and one when it is not.

# Whichever of the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries exist are tested. It is also
# possible to select which to test by the arguments -8 or -16.

# Other arguments for this script can be individual test numbers, or the word
# "valgrind", or "sim" followed by an argument to run cross-compiled
# executables under a simulator, for example:
#
# RunTest 3 sim "qemu-arm -s 8388608"
