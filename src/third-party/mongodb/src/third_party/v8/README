This directory contains (as of writing) the latest version of V8 on
the 3.12 branch.  See src/version.cc for the full version number.

Use the following to generate the base tree:

    git clone -b 3.12 git://github.com/v8/v8

These V8 files have been removed from the base tree for cleanliness
and to satisfy space constraints:

    benchmarks/
    build/
    DEPS
    Makefile
    Makefile.android
    preparser/
    samples/
    SConstruct
    src/SConscript
    src/arm/
    src/mips/
    test/

And these files have been added to complete the integration with the
MongoDB build system:

    README
    SConscript [1]

[1] The contents of this file are heavily borrowed from V8's
    src/SConscript.
