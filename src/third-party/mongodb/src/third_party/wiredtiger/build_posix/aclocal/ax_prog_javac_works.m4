# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVAC_WORKS
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Internal use ONLY.
#
#   Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
#   It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
#   on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
#   concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
#   general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
#   in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.
