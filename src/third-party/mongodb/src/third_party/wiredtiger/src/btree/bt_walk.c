	 * (3) discarding pages (close);
	 * (4) truncating pages in a range (fast truncate);
	 * (5) skipping pages based on outside information (compaction);
	 * (6) cursor scans (applications).
	 *
	 * Except for cursor scans and compaction, the walk is limited to the
	 * cache, no pages are read.  In all cases, hazard pointers protect the
	 * walked pages from eviction.
	 *
	 * Walks use hazard-pointer coupling through the tree and that's OK
	 * (hazard pointers can't deadlock, so there's none of the usual
	 * problems found when logically locking up a btree).  If the eviction
	 * thread tries to evict the active page, it fails because of our
	 * hazard pointer.  If eviction tries to evict our parent, that fails
	 * because the parent has a child page that can't be discarded.  We do
	 * play one game: don't couple up to our parent and then back down to a
	 * new leaf, couple to the next page to which we're descending, it
	 * saves a hazard-pointer swap for each cursor page movement.
	 *
	 * !!!
	 * NOTE: we depend on the fact it's OK to release a page we don't hold,
	 * that is, it's OK to release couple when couple is set to NULL.
	 *
	 * Take a copy of any held page and clear the return value.  Remember
	 * the hazard pointer we're currently holding.
	 *
	 * We may be passed a pointer to btree->evict_page that we are clearing
	 * here.  We check when discarding pages that we're not discarding that
	 * page, so this clear must be done before the page is released.
