 * Page state.
 *
 * Synchronization is based on the WT_REF->state field, which has a number of
 * possible states:
 *
 * WT_REF_DISK:
 *	The initial setting before a page is brought into memory, and set as a
 *	result of page eviction; the page is on disk, and must be read into
 *	memory before use.  WT_REF_DISK has a value of 0 (the default state
 *	after allocating cleared memory).
 *
 * WT_REF_DELETED:
 *	The page is on disk, but has been deleted from the tree; we can delete
 *	row-store leaf pages without reading them if they don't reference
 *	overflow items.
 *
 * WT_REF_LOCKED:
 *	Locked for exclusive access.  In eviction, this page or a parent has
 *	been selected for eviction; once hazard pointers are checked, the page
 *	will be evicted.  When reading a page that was previously deleted, it
 *	is locked until the page is in memory with records marked deleted.  The
 *	thread that set the page to WT_REF_LOCKED has exclusive access, no
 *	other thread may use the WT_REF until the state is changed.
 *
 * WT_REF_MEM:
 *	Set by a reading thread once the page has been read from disk; the page
 *	is in the cache and the page reference is OK.
 *
 * WT_REF_READING:
 *	Set by a reading thread before reading an ordinary page from disk;
 *	other readers of the page wait until the read completes.  Sync can
 *	safely skip over such pages: they are clean by definition.
 *
 * WT_REF_SPLIT:
 *	Set when the page is split; the WT_REF is dead and can no longer be
 *	used.
 *
 * The life cycle of a typical page goes like this: pages are read into memory
 * from disk and their state set to WT_REF_MEM.  When the page is selected for
 * eviction, the page state is set to WT_REF_LOCKED.  In all cases, evicting
 * threads reset the page's state when finished with the page: if eviction was
 * successful (a clean page was discarded, and a dirty page was written to disk
 * and then discarded), the page state is set to WT_REF_DISK; if eviction failed
 * because the page was busy, page state is reset to WT_REF_MEM.
 *
 * Readers check the state field and if it's WT_REF_MEM, they set a hazard
 * pointer to the page, flush memory and re-confirm the page state.  If the
 * page state is unchanged, the reader has a valid reference and can proceed.
 *
 * When an evicting thread wants to discard a page from the tree, it sets the
 * WT_REF_LOCKED state, flushes memory, then checks hazard pointers.  If a

 * because the page's entry no longer references a set of identical items.  We
 * handle this by "inserting" a new entry into the insert array, with its own
 * record number.  (This is the only case where it's possible to insert into a
 * column-store: only appends are allowed, as insert requires re-numbering
 * subsequent records.  Berkeley DB did support mutable records, but it won't
