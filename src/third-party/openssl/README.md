What is OpenSSL
===============

We are using OpenSSL-CMake distribution:
http://www.valvers.com/open-software/projects/openssl-cmake/

This project on Launchpad:
https://launchpad.net/openssl-cmake

Current version is 1.0.1e


CMake integration
=================

Original CMake listfiles in the `sources` folder are *not* used by Robomongo. 
Instead, we are using slightly modified CMake script, that is almost the same 
as original listfiles.
