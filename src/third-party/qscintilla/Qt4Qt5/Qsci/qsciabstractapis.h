//! \brief The QsciAbstractAPIs class represents the interface to the textual
//! API information used in call tips and for auto-completion.  A sub-class
//! will provide the actual implementation of the interface.
//!
//! API information is specific to a particular language lexer but can be
//! shared by multiple instances of the lexer.

    //! lexer becomes the instance's parent object although the instance can
    //! also be subsequently attached to other lexers.

    //! context is the list of words in the text preceding the cursor position.
    //! The characters that make up a word and the characters that separate
    //! words are defined by the lexer.  The last word is a partial word and
    //! may be empty if the user has just entered a word separator.

    //! position.  The exact position of the list of call tips can be adjusted
    //! by specifying a corresponding left character shift in \a shifts.  This
    //! is normally done to correct for any displayed context according to \a
    //! style.
